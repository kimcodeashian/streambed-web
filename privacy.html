      <h3 class="streamBlue">Your California Privacy Rights</h3> 

      <p>Persons with disabilities may obtain this notice in alternative format upon request by contacting us at info@streambedmedia.com or by calling us at +1-647-812-2036.</p> 

      <p>Residents of the State of California have the right to request information regarding third parties to whom companies have disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes at this time.</p> 

      <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of “personal information,” as well as rights to access and control personal information. The CCPA defines “personal information” to mean “information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Certain information we collect may be exempt from the CCPA because it is considered publicly available information (i.e., it is made available by a government entity) or covered by a federal privacy law, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p> 

      <p>To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and our rights are described below.</p> 

      <h4 class="streamPurple font-italic">Right to Information Regarding the Categories of Personal Information Collected, Sold, and Disclosed</h4> 

      <p>The following is a description of our data collection practices, including the personal information we collect, the sources of that information, the purposes for which we collect information, and whether we disclose that information to external parties. We may use any and all of the information for any of the purposes described in this Policy, unless limitations are listed. The categories we use to describe the information are those enumerated in the CCPA. </p>

      <ul><li><p><b>Personal Identifiers:</b></p></li></ul>

      <p>We do not collect your Social Security number, Driver’s License number, or Passport number. We do not collect your IP address or device identifier.</p> 

      <ul><li><p><b>Protected Classifications:</b> We do not collect your age, disability status, gender, race, ethnic origin, religious affiliation, or sexual orientation. </p> </li>

[f you contact us via phone, we may record the call. We will notify you if a call is being recorded at the beginning of the call.</p> </li>

      <li><p><b>Professional or employment-related information:</b> We collect information related to your company name and job title if you choose to provide it to us. We do not otherwise collect your professional or employment-related information.</p></li> 

      <li><p><b>Education information:</b> We do not collect any information about the institutions you have attended or the level of education you have attained.</p></li> 

      <li><p><b>Inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or characteristics:</b> We analyze or your actual or likely preferences through a series of computer processes and add our observations to your internal profile. We use this information to gauge and develop our marketing activities, and to measure the appeal and effectiveness of our services, applications, and tools.</p></li></ul>

      <p>We may share any of the above-listed information with Service Providers, which are external parties that we engage for business purposes and are restricted from using Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. The categories of Service Providers with whom we share information and the services they provide are described in this Policy.</p> 

      <p>Under the CCPA, to “sell” information means to disclose it to an external party for monetary or other benefit. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.</p> 

      <h4 class="streamPurple font-italic">Right to Information Regarding Participation in Data Sharing for Financial Incentives</h4> 

      <p>We may run promotions from time to time whereby we incentivize you to share certain pieces of information with us. Participation in these incentives is voluntary and you may opt out of the data sharing at any time.</p> 

      <h4 class="streamPurple font-italic">Right to Opt Out of Sale of Personal Information to Third Parties</h4>
