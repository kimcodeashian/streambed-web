     <h3 class="streamBlue">Section 9: General Provisions </h3>

     <h4 class="streamPurple font-italic">a. Modification</h4> 

     <p>We may modify the Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the Services. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will post notice of modifications to the Terms to this website. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for the Services, you should discontinue your use of the Services. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms. However, this section will not apply to any amendments or modifications to these Terms that have been signed by both parties. Such amendments or modifications may only be changed via a document signed by both parties.</p> 

     <h4 class="streamPurple font-italic">b. General Legal Terms</h4>

     <p>We each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Streambed does not take action right away, this does not mean that Streambed is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Streambed relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. For information about how to contact Streambed, please visit our contact page.</p> 

     <p>Except as set forth below: (i) the laws of New York, U.S.A., excluding New York’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms and the Services and (ii) ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE SERVICES WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK, USA, AND YOU AND GFYCAT CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THOSE COURTS. </p>

     <p>If you are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States federal government entity, then the following applies instead of the paragraph above: the laws of the United States of America, excluding its conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the Services. Solely to the extent permitted by United States Federal law: (i) the laws of the New York (excluding New York's conflict of laws rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal law; and (ii) FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE SERVICES, THE PARTIES CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE COURTS IN NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK. </p>

     <p>If you are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States city, county, or state government entity, then the following applies instead of the paragraph above: the parties agree to remain silent regarding governing law and venue.</p>
